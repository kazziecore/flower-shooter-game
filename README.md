The player shoots the enemies and the score resets upon death

GAME DESIGN DOCUMENT:
I originally set out to make a game where you shot flowers with a hot pink gun, but I felt that that didn't feel very cohesive so I changed my idea to be that the player is the flower and they are defending themselves from bugs trying to eat and attack them. 
The background of the level is a parralax background of one image multiplied.
